		<h1>About Frugal Mail</h1>
		<p>
			Frugal Mail was made to solve a problem by getting important parcels traveling accross the globe to their location quickly and cheaply for American domiciled teachers and expats in Asia. No large items are accepted!
		</p>
	</br>
		<p>
			How the system works is the "From Person" mails cheaply and domestically via USPS (or hand delivers) to the courier("a person who is going on an international flight to China"). The courier than completes the flight and meets up with the "To Person", ideally the "To Person" or "From Person" tips the courier. If they cannont meet, droping off the package with the local mailing system should work. The biggest lag could be getting domestic mail to the courier, despite that it can be 50% cheaper and faster than FedEx International Overnight.
